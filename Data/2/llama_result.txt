                         Abstract         Aalto University         USENIX Association
This is an example for a USENIX paper, in the form
of an HTML/CSS template. Being heavily self-ref-
erential, this template illustrates the features in-
cluded in this template. It is expected that the
prospective authors using HTML/CSS would create
a new document based on this template, remove
the content, and start writing their paper.
     Note that in this template, you may have a mul-
ti-paragraph abstract. However, that it is not nec-
essarily a good practice. Try to keep your abstract
in one paragraph, and remember that the optimal
length for an abstract is 200-300 words.
1 Introduction
For the purposes of USENIX conference publica-
tions, the authors, not the USENIX staff, are solely
responsible for the content and formatting of their
paper. The purpose of this template is to help
those authors that want to use HTML/CSS to write                      Figure 1:   This figure is showed for illustrational purpos-
their papers. This template has been prepared by                      es only; floppy disks are not required to use this tem-
