LEAD THE WAY
DARKNESS
In the dark, travel through the wilderness is dangerous. Getting lost or choosing the wrong path is an ever-present risk. The path- finder’s rolls get a — penalty during the dark Quarter Days of the day, and everyone in the group without the ability to see in the dark must make a SCOUTING roll — failure means they fall and take 1 point of damage to Strength.
Every time you move on the map, you must appoint one person to LEAD THE WAY. This individual is called the pathfinder. The path- finder can LEAD THE WAY and HIKE at the same time, but they cannot also KEEP WATCH (see below). Usually, the same person will act as pathfinder for an entire Quarter Day, but nothing stops you from changing the path- finder whenever you enter a new hexagon.
The winters are darker than the summers in the Forbidden Lands. In the winter, there is light only during the Day, while all the other Quarter Days are dark. In autumn and spring there is light in the Morning and Day, while the Evening and the Night are dark. In summer, darkness only reigns during the Night. See the table above.
Every time you enter a new hexagon on the map, the pathfinder makes a SURVIVAL roll, modified by the PATHFINDER talent if she has it. Success means you find a viable path into the hexagon and you move on without any problems. Failure means that you still enter the hexagon, but you suffer a mishap and must immediately roll on the table on the next page.
BACK AGAIN?
If you return to a hex on the map where you have been before, you don’t need to make an- other roll to LEAD THE WAY. It is up to you the players to keep track of where you have been during your journeys.
