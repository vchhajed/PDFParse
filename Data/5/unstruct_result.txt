Comments
The commercial polymeric resin used for the production of the biocomposite panel, contains the ﬂame retardant agent. From the chemical analysis carried out for the commercial resin (detailed in the SI-3), a 1.63 epoxy/ﬂame retardant ratio was determined. Since no consequential process were available, the one mentioned herein was used as starting point and adjusted with consequential data. A detailed description of the modiﬁcations is available in the SI-4.
From Vidal et al. (2018), the ﬂame retardant agent used in the conventional panel is identiﬁed as decaBDE. From the chemical analysis of the commercial hardener used for the biocomposite panel (detailed in the SI-3), three main substances were identiﬁed: isophorone diamine, alkylether polyamine and methylamine. Only the production of methylamine is present in the Ecoinvent database. As the toxicity of the three molecules is highly similar, this process was used as proxy. This dataset comprises all activities from the agricultural phase to the weaving of the textile, and includes land use changes.
The most commonly used material in honeycomb core structures is known as NOMEX (Morton-Jones and Ellis 1986) and is described as a type of nylon. Based on this and on literature work involving the production of aramid ﬁbre (Wilhelm 2018), the production process of nylon was used as a proxy for aramid ﬁbre production.
Based on this and on literature work involving the production of aramid fibre (Wilhelm 2018), the production process of nylon was used as a proxy for aramid fibre production

The range of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that it will be used for intracontinental ﬂights within Europe. The “Transport, passenger, aircraft {RER}| intracontinental | Conseq, U” process from the Ecoinvent v3.4 database was therefore taken as reference for the estimation of direct emissions linked to the kerosene con- sumption on a medium haul aircraft. The kilograms of kerosene consumed per m2 of panel per the lifetime of the aircraft (KCP) were calculated through the following equation:
