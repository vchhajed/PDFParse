The range of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that it will

be used for intracontinental flights within Europe. The “Transport,

passenger, aircraft {RER}| intracontinental | Conseq, U” process

from the Ecoinvent v3.4 database was therefore taken as reference

for the estimation of direct emissions linked to the kerosene con-
sumption on a medium haul aircraft. The kilograms of kerosene

consumed per m2 of panel per the lifetime of the aircraft (KCP)

were calculated through the following equation:

Epoxy resin Ecoinvent

v3.4

Epoxy resin {GLO}| market for epoxy resin

| Conseq, U

The commercial polymeric resin used for the production of the biocomposite panel,

contains the flame retardant agent. From the chemical analysis carried out for the

commercial resin (detailed in the SI-3), a 1.63 epoxy/flame retardant ratio was

determined.

Since no consequential process were available, the one mentioned herein was used as

starting point and adjusted with consequential data. A detailed description of the

modifications is available in the SI-4.

Decabromodiphenyl

ether (decaBDE)

Ecoinvent

v3.4

Decabromodiphenyl ether {GLO}| market

for decabromodiphenyl ether | Conseq, U

From Vidal et al. (2018), the flame retardant agent used in the conventional panel is

identified as decaBDE.

Methylamine Ecoinvent 3.4 Methylamine {GLO}| market for | Conseq,

U

From the chemical analysis of the commercial hardener used for the biocomposite panel

(detailed in the SI-3), three main substances were identified: isophorone diamine,

alkylether polyamine and methylamine.

(Used as proxy) Only the production of methylamine is present in the Ecoinvent database. As the toxicity

of the three molecules is highly similar, this process was used as proxy.

Nylon 6-6 {GLO} | market for | Conseq, U

(Used as proxy)

The most commonly used material in honeycomb core structures is known as NOMEX

(Morton-Jones and Ellis 1986) and is described as a type of nylon.

Based on this and on literature work involving the production of aramid fibre (Wilhelm

2018), the production process of nylon was used as a proxy for aramid fibre production.
