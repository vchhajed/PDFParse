                      There are many reasons for using Prince. We will show you 8.
one: JavaScript Prince supports JavaScript so that programmers can                  three: CSS3 columns This document is laid out in two columns on the

                For example, this document has a small script that au-                                  therefore only has room for one column. The
                tomatically generates a table of contents:                                              number of columns is automatically adjusted based

two: More JavaScriptThis document lists 8 numbered features. Notice that the                pages instead of elements.
                first three features are numbered with spelled-out numbers,
                while the rest use digits. This is achieved with a small script
                that exchanges digits for letters when the number is three or       5: CSS3 transforms
                smaller.                                                                    CSS3 introduces transforms, which can be used to scale and

         rotate elements. «Prince» is rotated 90 degerees on the right.                                      Prince
         Also, it has been moved to a margin box so that it appears
         outside the normal text flow.
6: Background imagesThe image on the right is used as the
         background image on the first page.
         There, only part of the image is visible.
         This is achieved by carefully setting the
         position and pixel-density of the image.
         Also, notice how the background image is
         «bleeding»; it extends slightly outside the
         page to avoid white edges when the paper
         is cut.
7: CSS3 selectorsNotice how every other item in our list of eight is in italics. This is achieved by
        selecting and styling even-numbered items.
8: More transformsTransforms can be applied to images as well as text. Below is the blue-sky background im-
         age rotated at various angles.
