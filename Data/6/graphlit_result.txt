impact categories, the Raw Materials stage was identified to be

responsible for up to 99% of the environmental impact of the bio-
composite panel and over 65% for all categories for the conven-
tional panel (Table 7).

Further analysis of the raw materials of both panels showed that

for the biocomposite panel, the flame retardant agent and the

production of the flax fibre technical textile are the main contrib-
utors to the studied environmental impacts (Fig. 6). On the other

hand, glass fibre and aramid fibre production are the main con-
tributors to the environmental impacts of the conventional panel,

followed by the flame retardant agent and the epoxy resin pro-
duction (Fig. 7).

From comparing the performance of both panels, results

showed (Fig. 8) that the biocomposite panel has a better perfor-
mance in the environmental impact categories of Climate change

and Marine eutrophication than the conventional panel. However,

the conventional panel outperforms the biocomposite panel in all

the other categories (Ozone depletion, Particulate matter, Ionizing

radiation, Photochemical ozone formation, Acidification, Fresh-
water eutrophication and Mineral, fossil & renewable resources

depletion).

To identify the strengths and weaknesses of the biocomposite

panel, the main contributors to each of the impact categories were

identified. Findings are summarized in Table 8, which presents the

performance of the biocomposite panel compared to the conven-
tional panel and the process/main contributors responsible for the

potential environmental impacts for each category.

4. Discussion

! From a Cradle-to-Grave’s perspective

For an application in aeronautics, the critical element of the

panel is its mass as it has a direct influence on fuel consumption

and therefore on the level of air emissions. This is revealed in

Table 6 where the use phase is shown to represent more than 99%
