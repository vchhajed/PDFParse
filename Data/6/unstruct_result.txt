impact categories, the Raw Materials stage was identiﬁed to be responsible for up to 99% of the environmental impact of the bio- composite panel and over 65% for all categories for the conven- tional panel (Table 7).
Further analysis of the raw materials of both panels showed that for the biocomposite panel, the ﬂame retardant agent and the production of the ﬂax ﬁbre technical textile are the main contrib- utors to the studied environmental impacts (Fig. 6). On the other hand, glass ﬁbre and aramid ﬁbre production are the main con- tributors to the environmental impacts of the conventional panel, followed by the ﬂame retardant agent and the epoxy resin pro- duction (Fig. 7).

To identify the strengths and weaknesses of the biocomposite panel, the main contributors to each of the impact categories were identiﬁed. Findings are summarized in Table 8, which presents the performance of the biocomposite panel compared to the conven- tional panel and the process/main contributors responsible for the potential environmental impacts for each category.
4. Discussion
From comparing the performance of both panels, results showed (Fig. 8) that the biocomposite panel has a better perfor- mance in the environmental impact categories of Climate change and Marine eutrophication than the conventional panel. However, the conventional panel outperforms the biocomposite panel in all the other categories (Ozone depletion, Particulate matter, Ionizing

!
For an application in aeronautics, the critical element of the panel is its mass as it has a direct inﬂuence on fuel consumption and therefore on the level of air emissions. This is revealed in Table 6 where the use phase is shown to represent more than 99%
