that they employ a cloud-first deployment methodology. An additional 44% said that they weigh on-premises technology
and public cloud services equally when considering their deployment options. Only 19% of respondents employed an on-
premises-first philosophy.        1
SAST and DAST Obtain Equal Priority
Traditional application development distinguished between internal and external apps. There is a perception that internal
apps have limited security risks and possibilities for compromise because they were hidden behind the corporate firewall,
and were only used by internal employees. Externally facing apps, or apps with public users, were perceived to have much
greater risk. This perception seems to explain the fact that 66% of respondents employ SAST for internal applications while
only 51% employ DAST for internal applications.
However, mobile- and cloud-first initiatives may be blurring the lines between what is considered internal or external.
Users accessing corporate data through cloud or mobile apps may bypass the corporate firewall to access apps using
insecure public and cellular networks. Performing both static and dynamic testing of all apps, and incorporating and
automating AppSec into AppDev should become a best practice, regardless of the app deployment or use model. This
concept is reflected in the research results: Including respondents that are interested in SAST and DAST respectively, usage
for each should normalize over time (see Figure 4).

In traditional development organizations, the security team was siloed from the development team. Often, security was an
afterthought—something to be bolted on to the app at the end of the development processes. This led to vulnerabilities
being discovered mostly after the fact, when the app was compromised and the organization was breached. However, ESG
