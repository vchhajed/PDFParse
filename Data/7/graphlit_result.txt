conventional panel in the impact categories of climate change and

marine eutrophication, by 34% and 30%, respectively. Yet climate

change gains are fictitious if the lifespan of the panel is short, as the

stored carbon will be released into the atmosphere at the end of the

panel’s life. The processes identified as responsible for the overall

environmental impacts of the panels are essentially linked to the

procurement of raw materials. Agricultural activities (such as zinc

amendments to soil treatment and fertilizer production) are the

main processes responsible for the higher environmental impact of

the biocomposite panel when compared to the conventional one.

The valorisation of co-products, on the other hand, affects both

positively and negatively the environmental performance of the

bio-based panels and must not be neglected from the system

boundary.

Given that materials in the aviation sector have a lifespan of 30

years and over, a biocomposite panel represents a relevant option

when it comes to climate change mitigation. It was calculated that

through the use of bio-based panels as elements in interior fittings

in airplanes for the next 20 years, the emission of over 75 megatons

of CO2 could be delayed. However, production processes and reg-
ulations are yet to be optimized and adjusted for biocomposite

materials to have a place in the aviation sector.

FUNDING

The work was carried out as part of the doctoral thesis of A.
