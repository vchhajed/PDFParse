abstract

As part of the efforts to reduce the environmental impacts caused by the aviation sector, the use of bio-
based instead of fossil-based materials has been proposed as one possible mitigation option. Natural

Fibre Polymer Composites have proven to have a higher environmental performance in the automotive

sector and are emerging as an option for weight reduction in aircrafts. This study quantifies, through Life

Cycle Assessment, the environmental performance of specific flax-based composite panels intended for

aircrafts as interior fitting elements (i.e. partition panels, tray tables, baggage compartments) compared

to a glass fibre/epoxy composite with a honeycomb core. Through system expansion, the fate of co-
products issued from the production of the flax fibre technical textile used as reinforcement in the

biocomposite material was considered in the assessment.

Results: showed that for an application in the aeronautics sector, the weight of the panels is the upmost

critical parameter shaping the overall environmental performance of panels. Focusing on the panel

production only, the biocomposite panel showed a higher environmental performance in the categories

of climate change and marine eutrophication compared to the conventional panel, and the fire sup-
pressant agent was identified as the main contributor to the environmental impacts of the bio-based

panel. Yet these gains were negligible when considering the full life cycle of the panels, due to the

higher weight (14%) of the bio-based panels; which is linked to the bio-based panel being still at the

prototype stage.

In order to improve the environmental performance of the biocomposite panel and thus reduce its

weight, it was shown relevant to optimize the geometry of the panel itself, especially its core, so less

resin could be used.

1. Introduction

Though it only represents a little over 2% of global greenhouse

gas (GHG) emissions (Graver et al., 2019), aviation is becoming a

growing public concern in the light of the current climate urgency

(IPCC 2018). Because fuel represents ca. 25% of operating expenses

for the global air transport industry (IATA 2019), efforts to reduce

fuel consumption have already been undertaken by the sector. In

2011, the European Commission, through the Advisory Council for

Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE), published

five goals to be achieved in the Flightpath 2050 report. One of these

goals targets a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions and a 90% reduction

in NOx emissions per passenger kilometre, while another goal aims

for aircrafts to be recyclable (ACARE 2011).

In an attempt to achieve these goals, lighter materials have been

researched to replace those currently used, this allowing for lower

fuel use. Indeed, jet fuel used during an aircraft lifetime is in fact

responsible for more than 75% of the GH emissions in the whole life

cycle (Bachmann et al., 2017). Moreover, these GHG emissions are

more environmentally damaging compared to those emitted at

ground level due to the increased interaction of gases at higher
